## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/temporal-log-analysis-tool.git
   cd temporal-log-analysis-tool
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
## Running the Application
   1. Run the main application:
       ```bash
       python main.py
   2. Access the GUI to start analyzing logs in real-time.

## 🔒 Security Considerations
Implemented access controls to restrict log analysis to authorized users.
Ensured secure handling of sensitive event logs to protect user data.
